# ggpackage: The Smart package.xml Generator

Tired of manually writing `package.xml` for every deployment? ggpackage is the ultimate tool to automate the creation of Salesforce manifests, right from your VS Code.

With just a few clicks, select files, folders, or changes from Source Control and instantly generate a clean, sorted, and ready-to-use `package.xml`.

âœ¨ **Features**
---
âœ… **Contextual Generation:** Works where you need it. Generate your manifest from the File Explorer or directly from the Source Control view (modified/staged files).

ðŸ“‚ **Multiple Selections Support:** Select a single file, multiple files at once, or even entire folders (like classes, lwc, or an object's folder) to generate a complete manifest in bulk.

ðŸ’… **Automatic Formatting:** The generated `package.xml` is always well-formatted and sorted alphabetically by metadata type and component name, making it easy to read and version control.

ðŸš€ **Quick and Intuitive Access:** No complicated commands. The functionality is just a right-click away in the context menu, exactly where you work.
